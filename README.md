- :books: Iâ€™m currently pursuing my master's degree in **Computer Science** at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. I have recently completed a dual major BSc in **CS & Physics** 
- :microscope: As for my MSc, I'm part of the [Micro-Flight Lab](https://www.beatus-lab.org/) - Our goal Understanding the mechanisms of insect flight and implementing them in biomimetic robots. <br>
- My part is **Developing and utilizing an end-to-end computer vision system**, which includes:
  - **Multi-camera calibration** for capturing high-speed videos (16K fps) of flying insects.
  - Engineering an **ensemble of instance segmentation and pose estimation deep neural networks (DNNs)**; labeling, training, and deploying them to analyze insectsâ€™ **flight dynamics**.
  - Performing **3D reconstruction and simulation** of insectsâ€™ **wings and body dynamics** using multi-camera detections, applying **novel optimization methods** that have achieved **unprecedented, state-of-the-art results** in the field.
  - **Devising and utilizing several validation methods** to ensure the **stability and accuracy** of the system.
- My other projects include all kinds of machine learning, deep learning and computer vision challenges

### ðŸŽ¥ Experimental Setup

<p align="left">
  Four synchronized and calibrated high-speed cameras, capturing at an impressive 16,000 frames per second (fps), record flying insects in real-time. For context, the wingbeat frequency here is around 200 Hz, allowing us to capture intricate details of wing and body dynamics.

**On the left side**, youâ€™ll see the **hand-picked feature points**, automatically detected across all four views. This detection is powered by a **trained ensemble of deep neural networks**, which **identifies points** in each view independently. These 2D detections from multiple views are later **aggregated using novel optimization technics into optimal 3D points**.

**On the right side**, youâ€™ll observe the **reconstructed 3D points**, enhanced with additional annotations:

* The **green plane** represents the **'stroke plane'**: the imaginary plane through which the insect's wings move during each wingbeat.
* The **three arrows** in the center define the insect's **internal 3D coordinate system**.
* Each wing features **two arrows** representing the **chord and span** (x and y axes) of the wing's coordinate system.
